        <p>
          in the end of last winter i visited cox bazar with my friends . we
          also went to saint martin but in this picture i am in cox bazar
          sugandha beach. the air was hot with heavy sun shine but the water of
          sea was so cold . it was my first tour to cox bazar. so i was so much
          excited and enjoyed so much. we had started our journey at 8pm and
          reached at 10am so it was a long journey .
